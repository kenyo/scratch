Iterate on teaching process:

Setup
`npm i -g nodemon`
`nodemon path/to/wks/main.js`

# create wk# dir for each week's session
# copy/create main.template.js from root into dir
# live code off of main.js but save as problemName.js
# after complete session push all changes to github

...and more generally:
# talk
# refactor
# narrate a shared problem
